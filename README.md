# Breast Cancer PCA and Logistic Regression

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the application of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the breast cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets`. The dataset is reduced to 2 principal components. Additionally, logistic regression is implemented for prediction using the reduced dataset.

## Instructions

1. **Load the Dataset**: The breast cancer dataset is loaded from `sklearn.datasets`.
2. **Implement PCA**: PCA is applied to the dataset to reduce its dimensions.
3. **Dimensionality Reduction**: The dataset is reduced to 2 PCA components.
4. **Bonus - Logistic Regression**: Logistic regression is implemented for prediction using the reduced dataset.

## Dependencies

- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Running the Code

1. Clone the repository or unzip the provided file.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the provided script (`main.py`) to execute the PCA and logistic regression steps.

```bash
python main.py
